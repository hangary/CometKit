# CometKit: Personal Search Algorithm for Exocomets! 

### What is CometKit? 
CometKit is an open source package for exocomet searching in lightcurves. 

### How does CometKit Work? 
ComeKit is comprised of two main components. You can tweak/use either section to suit your needs: 

1. CNN Candidate Detection - Spline Detrending + CNN trained from 100K exocomet samples.
2. MCMC Parameterization - MCMC with Gaussian Process detrending integrated for seemless parameterization + candidate confirmation
